# CISS sampling and vdW-inclusive MLP

This directory tracks the upcoming CISS sampling workflow and the dispersion-consistent MLP (SO3-equivariant with explicit long-range terms). Details, benchmarks, and training scripts will be released with the next two papers.

Planned contents:
- CISS dataset curation and sampling scripts.
- Long-range vdW potential components and model configs.
- Reproducibility notes and release checklists once the papers are out.
