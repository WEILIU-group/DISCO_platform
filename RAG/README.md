# RAG knowledge base

This directory documents the RAG stack we pair with CherryStudio plus an internal ~20k literature corpus. The current repo keeps only metadata docs; the full corpus and retrieval indices stay in private storage for licensing reasons.

Planned contents (to be added here):
- Connector scripts for syncing the in-house library into CherryStudio.
- Extraction and figure-generation pipeline descriptions.
- Example queries and evaluation notes once sanitization is done.

If you need access to the private corpus or indices, please request credentials offline.
